# Project Template

Repository template for software projects.

## Wiki Template

This project template works best in combination with the [wiki-repo-template](https://github.com/mhatzl/wiki-repo-template).
The wiki should be used to document development decisions and requirements.

## Template Placeholders

In this template, many sections include placeholder text to provide some guidance of what the section should be about.
These placeholders are inside `{{ }}` blocks.

Some sections also include example content that is given inside `[[ ]]` blocks.

## GitHub Actions

This template already contains the following GitHub actions:

- `auto-lock-prs` ... Used to lock PRs once they are closed
- `release-please` ... Uses Google's [release please](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) action to generate releases automatically

  **Note:** You should adapt this action according to your needs.
