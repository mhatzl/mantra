# [req(id.sub_id_1.sub_sub_id_1.sub_sub_sub_id_1, id.sub_id_1.sub_sub_id_1.sub_sub_sub_id_2)]
# These traces result in indirect traces for 'id.sub_id_1.sub_sub_id_1'
#
# But 'id.sub_id_1' is **not** traced, because it has no direct traces
# and 'id.sub_id_1.sub_sub_id_2' is not traced, so 'id.sub_id_1' is also not indirectly traced.

# [req(id.sub_id_2.sub_sub_id_1, id.sub_id_2.sub_sub_id_2)]
# These traces result in indirect traces for `id.sub_id_2`
# eventhough the sub-sub-sub ids for `id.sub_id_2` are not traced.

# [req(id.sub_id_3)]
# Creates a direct trace for 'id.sub_id_3' eventhough all child requirements are **not** traced.

# Because 'id.sub_id_1' is **not** traced, 'id' is also **not** indirectly traced.
